Added standardized section warning messages for missing/empty sections and very short sections (< 50 words).

Guardrails Logic (Updated)
Variables
evidence_mode → controls evidence strictness

Allowed values: "default", "strict"

Evidence Mode Behavior
Case A: evidence_mode = "default"

Summarizer may generate summaries using normal logic.

Can paraphrase and synthesize content freely, but must remain grounded in the source text.

Case B: evidence_mode = "strict"

Summarizer must only include claims, equations, and results explicitly present in the source text.

No extrapolation, speculation, or outside knowledge.

If insufficient detail is found, output the standardized message:

The source text does not provide enough detail to summarize this section in strict evidence mode.

Section Warning Messages
For each section processed:

If section is missing or empty → output:

Section skipped: no usable text was provided.
If section length < 50 words → output:

Section very short: summary may be incomplete.
